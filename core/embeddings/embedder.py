"""
core/embeddings/embedder.py — Embeds code chunks and stores them in Qdrant.

Supports two indexing modes:
  1. Full index  — first-time ingestion. Deletes stale collection, creates fresh.
  2. Incremental — re-ingestion after a commit. Upserts changed chunks, deletes
                   stale ones by file_path filter.

Key design decision: deterministic point IDs.
  Old approach: sequential ints (0, 1, 2, ...) — different on every run.
  New approach: MD5 hash of (repo_name, file_path, chunk_name, start_line).
  This means the same code chunk always gets the same ID, enabling upserts
  (Qdrant overwrites existing points with matching IDs) and targeted deletes.

Note on _qdrant.add() vs _qdrant.upsert():
  _qdrant.add() is the FastEmbed-integrated method — it embeds text AND stores.
  _qdrant.upsert() stores pre-computed vectors. We use add() because we want
  FastEmbed to handle embedding transparently.
