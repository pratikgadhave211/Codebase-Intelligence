core/llm/prompts.py — All prompt templates in one place.

Why one file for all prompts?
  When a prompt gives bad output, you fix it here.
  When you want to improve response quality, you experiment here.
  No hunting across 5 different route files.

Template syntax:
  Each prompt uses Python's .format() placeholders: {variable_name}
  Call it like: ANSWER_QUESTION.format(code_context=chunks, question=q)

Design principle for each prompt:
  1. Tell the model its role clearly
  2. Give it the code context (retrieved chunks)
  3. Give it the specific task
  4. Tell it the output format you expect
  5. Tell it to cite file names and line numbers

The "cite file and line numbers" instruction is critical.
Without it, the model makes up plausible-sounding but wrong locations.
With it, you get answers like "in src/auth.py at line 34" which are
verifiable and make the system feel trustworthy.

- Cite the exact file path and line number for every claim you make.

- If the code context does not contain enough information to answer,
  say "I cannot find enough information in the indexed code to answer this."

FIND_BUGS = """You are an expert code reviewer analysing a codebase for defects.

Below are code chunks from the repository:

{code_context}

--------------------------------------------------
TASK
--------------------------------------------------

Identify ONLY defects that are directly visible in the provided code.

Allowed findings:

- Logic errors
- Broken imports
- Exception/crash risks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Resource leaks
- Incorrect API usage
- Unreachable code
- Race conditions
- Null/None access risks
- File/path handling bugs

Do NOT report:

- Best practices
- Style issues
- Refactoring suggestions
- Missing validations unless a real bug is visible
- Missing type checks unless a concrete failure is visible
- Missing input validation unless a concrete failure is visible
- Defensive programming suggestions
- Hypothetical edge cases
- "Could be improved" comments
- Architectural opinions
- Performance suggestions
- Naming issues

--------------------------------------------------
VALIDATION RULE
--------------------------------------------------

A missing validation is NOT a bug unless the provided code demonstrates that invalid input can reach the code path and cause incorrect behaviour.

Do not report:

- Missing type checks
- Missing input validation
- Missing defensive checks

unless a concrete failure is visible in the provided code.

--------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
EVIDENCE RULE
--------------------------------------------------

Every reported issue must be provable from the provided code.

Before reporting an issue, inspect the surrounding code.

Verify that the code does NOT already handle the failure condition.

If the code already handles the failure condition using:

- try/except
- conditional checks
- guard clauses
- default values

DO NOT report the issue.

If you cannot point to a specific line or code fragment that demonstrates the issue:

DO NOT report it.

If you are uncertain:

DO NOT report it.

False positives are worse than missed issues.

--------------------------------------------------
LINE NUMBER RULE
--------------------------------------------------

Use only line numbers that are explicitly present in the provided code chunk metadata.

Do NOT invent line numbers.

If a line number is unavailable, use:

0

--------------------------------------------------
SEVERITY RULES
--------------------------------------------------

high:
- Security issue
- Data loss risk
- Crash likely in normal execution

medium:
- Logic bug
- Incorrect behaviour
- Runtime failure in specific situations

low:
- Minor defect with observable impact

--------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------

Return ONLY a JSON array.

Example:

[
  {{
    "file": "src/auth.py",
    "line": 34,
    "severity": "high",
    "issue": "Token validation can be bypassed.",
    "suggestion": "Validate the token before granting access."
  }}
]

If no defects are visible:

[]

Return ONLY valid JSON.
No markdown.
No explanations.
No text before or after the JSON.

EXPLAIN_ARCHITECTURE = """You are a senior software architect producing a codebase map.

Your job is to describe the REAL architecture of the repository.

You MUST use information from:

1. Dependency Graph Analysis
2. Repository Structure
3. Code Samples

The Dependency Graph Analysis is the PRIMARY source of truth.

--------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------

Produce EXACTLY TWO sections:

SUMMARY: A concise 2-4 sentence explanation of:

- What the project does
- Main technologies used
- Major entry points
- Major subsystems

Then output a Mermaid dependency diagram derived ONLY from Dependency Edges.

--------------------------------------------------
STRICT RULES
--------------------------------------------------

Use ONLY components that appear in:

- Dependency Graph Analysis
- Repository Structure
- Code Samples

DO NOT INVENT:

- Databases
- Storage layers
- Service layers
- Data layers
- Core logic
- Backend
- Frontend
- API Router
- Controllers
- Models

unless they explicitly exist in the repository.

DO NOT create generic architectural labels.

BAD:

- Core Logic
- Service Layer
- Data Models
- Storage
- Backend
- Frontend
- API Router

GOOD:

- webhook_router.py
- ai_processor.py
- weather_agent.py
- market_price_agent.py
- App.tsx
- main.py

Prefer actual file/module names from the graph.

If the dependency graph contains:

main.py -> webhook_router.py

then use those nodes directly.

Do NOT rename them.

--------------------------------------------------
MERMAID RULES
--------------------------------------------------

Start with:

```mermaid

First line:

flowchart TD

Node IDs:

- letters
- numbers
- underscores only

Valid:

A --> B
A -->|"imports"| B
A["main.py"]

Invalid:

A -->|"imports"|> B

Every referenced node must be defined.

Maximum:

- 20 nodes
- 30 edges

Use actual repository file/module names as labels.

Example:

A["main.py"]
B["webhook_router.py"]

A -->|"imports"| B

--------------------------------------------------
SUBGRAPH RULES
--------------------------------------------------

Subgraphs are OPTIONAL.

A valid Mermaid diagram WITHOUT subgraphs is preferred over an invalid diagram WITH subgraphs.

If you are unsure how to group components, do NOT use subgraphs.

Valid subgraph syntax:

subgraph API["API"]
    A["webhook_router.py"]
    B["router.py"]
end

Never use:

subgraph API["API"] {{
    A["webhook_router.py"]
}}

Curly braces {{}} are invalid Mermaid syntax.

Every subgraph must end with:

end

Nodes inside subgraphs MUST be actual repository files/modules.

Do NOT create generic nodes such as:

- API
- Core
- Backend
- Frontend
- Service Layer
- Storage
- Database

unless those names literally exist in the repository.

--------------------------------------------------
EDGE RULES
--------------------------------------------------

Every edge MUST come directly from Dependency Edges.

If an edge is not present in Dependency Edges,
DO NOT generate it.

Allowed labels:

- imports
- depends_on
- references

Do NOT use:

- calls
- executes
- runs
- handles
- processes
- starts

because runtime behavior cannot be proven from dependency analysis.

--------------------------------------------------
VALIDITY RULE
--------------------------------------------------

The Mermaid diagram MUST be syntactically valid.

If you are unsure, generate a simpler diagram with fewer nodes and no subgraphs.

A simple valid diagram is better than a complex invalid diagram.

DEPENDENCY GRAPH ANALYSIS

Node Count:
{node_count}

Edge Count:
{edge_count}

Entry Points:
{entry_points}

Most Depended On:
